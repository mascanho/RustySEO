## RustySEO - A cross-platform SEO toolkit

RustySEO is an all-in-one, cross-platform Marketing toolkit, designed for comprehensive SEO & GEO analysis. It enables users to crawl websites, analise server logs gaining actionable insights into their marketing and SEO strategies.

As an open-source project, RustySEO aims to enhance your SEO efforts. Please note that initial versions may have bugs and issues, and we welcome your contributions in the form of bug reports or fixes via our repository.

Our mission is to offer a robust, free alternative to the costly commercial SEO tools currently on the market.

Keep in mind that all the integrations are free to use (up to an extent). Its abuse will result in 404 or 503 by the providers.

As long as you don't spam (many requests per second) you should be ok to use RustySEO as your daily driver for SEO. :)

## 🔖 TL;DR

For a better experience you need to get a [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started) API KEY.

Got to "Connectors" > "PageSpeed Insights" and add your key, for the time being you can try one I generated (It will expire over time):

```bash
AIzaSyAHsCM-Cs4cCqdGi798wh8af-bSnXbVUjw
```

We recommend using Google Gemini if you want the best AI features.

As of today, the smaller local LLMs are not working properly and are not recommended if you want to make the most of the AI features.

These LLMs might get deprecated due to their lack of uniform performance across different models.

Authentication currently takes place server side, as such it is slightly more cumbersome when integrating with Google OAuth 2.0. This is particularly true
for Google Search Console (GSC) and Google Analytics 4 (GA4)

This authentication will be passed to the client-side in the future.

Use at your own risk, this software is new and under development.

## 🏗️ Architecture

RustySEO is a native desktop app, not a wrapped website — the crawler runs as a real, local process on your machine.

- **Shell**: [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) (Rust) — a lightweight, cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux) desktop shell using the OS's native webview instead of bundling a full browser engine.
- **Crawler engine**: Rust, async/concurrent (Tokio), with adaptive request throttling and optional JavaScript rendering via a headless Chrome instance for SPA / JS-heavy pages.
- **UI**: Next.js, React & TypeScript, rendered inside the native webview.
- **Storage**: SQLite, entirely local — crawl data, settings, history and reports live on your disk. RustySEO doesn't have a backend that your crawl data passes through.
- **Third-party connectors are opt-in and direct**: when you connect Google Search Console, GA4, PageSpeed Insights, Gemini, etc., the app talks to those APIs directly using your own credentials — nothing is proxied through a RustySEO server.
- **The one exception**: the built-in community chat and suggestion box, which is backed by a small Supabase project so messages/feedback can reach the team — entirely optional and unrelated to your crawl data.
