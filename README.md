## RustySEO - A cross-platform SEO toolkit

RustySEO is an all-in-one, cross-platform Marketing toolkit, designed for comprehensive SEO & GEO analysis. It enables users to crawl websites, analise server logs gaining actionable insights into their marketing and SEO strategies.

As an open-source project, RustySEO aims to enhance your SEO efforts. Please note that initial versions may have bugs and issues, and we welcome your contributions in the form of bug reports or fixes via our repository.

Our mission is to offer a robust, free alternative to the costly commercial SEO tools currently on the market.

Keep in mind that all the integrations are free to use (up to an extent). Its abuse will result in 404 or 503 by the providers.

As long as you don't spam (many requests per second) you should be ok to use RustySEO as your daily driver for SEO. :)

## üîñ TL;DR

For a better experience you need to get a [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/get-started) API KEY.

Got to "Connectors" > "PageSpeed Insights" and add your key, for the time being you can try one I generated (It will expire over time):

```bash
AIzaSyAHsCM-Cs4cCqdGi798wh8af-bSnXbVUjw
```

We recommend using Google Gemini if you want the best AI features.

As of today, the smaller local LLMs are not working properly and are not recommended if you want to make the most of the AI features.

These LLMs might get deprecated due to their lack of uniform performance across different models.

Authentication currently takes place server side, as such it is slightly more cumbersome when integrating with Google OAuth 2.0. This is particularly true
for Google Search Console (GSC) and Google Analytics 4 (GA4)

This authentication will be passed to the client-side in the future.

Use at your own risk, this software is new and under development.

# Setting up Google Search Console

- [Windows](#windows)
- [Mac OS](#usage)
- [Linux](#screenshots)

## Windows

To setup Google Search Console, follow these steps:

1. You need to set up [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with Search Console API enabled and Service Account active. Make sure you have full ownership of your GSC property.

2. Launch RustySEO;

3. Go to the menu **Connectors** üëâ **Search Console**

4. Add your Google Search Console credentials

![RustySEO](assets/ss1.png)

You can find all the details in your Google Cloud console account with the exception of the "URL" and "Property Type", which should match what you have in your Google Search console account.

![RustySEO](assets/properties.png)

5. Submit the credentials and your desired options

6. Restart RustySEO

7. Since windows does not allow to output logs into the terminal by default, we just need to force it so that we can grab the link generated on the server to generate our token. Google keeps changing this but the goal is to have it done client-side (once I have the time). Launch RustySEO from Windows Powershell with the following command:

```bash
C:\Users\[your user]\AppData\Local\rustyseo\rustyseo.exe | Tee-Object -Filepath "C:\Users\[your user]\Downloads\rusty.log"
```

This will output all the logs into powershell. You will see a link from Google Auth. Simply open it in your browser with the same account that you generated your GSC API. Accept.

8. Restart RustySEO after the token has been generated

9. You should now see your GSC data inside RustySEO

## Mac OSX

8. Restart RustySEO after the token has been generated

9. You should now see your GSC data inside RustySEO
